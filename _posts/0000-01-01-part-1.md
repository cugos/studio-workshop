title: Part I - The Basics of Mapbox Studio
---
What we'll cover:

- the Mapbox platform
- the studio interface and common terms
- Mapbox data - OpenStreetMap, Imagery, Terrain

<hr>

**[Mapbox Studio]({{site.url}}/mapbox-studio/)** is a modern design platform for managing your spatial data and creating custom map styles. Use Mapbox Studio to design a map to your exact specifications by using Mapbox-provided tilesets, uploading your own vector or raster data, adding custom fonts and images, or simply refining the built-in template map styles. With Mapbox Studio, full design control is at your fingertips.

This guide will walk you through the Mapbox Studio interface and get you acquainted with the tools for inspecting styles, uploading data, and managing your account.

## Home

**[Home]({{site.url}}/studio)** is your jumping-off point for building amazing maps with Mapbox Studio. This page shows your recently-edited styles, recently-added tilesets, and links to Mapbox developer tools for building web and mobile applications.

![home]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/home.png)

### Styles

The **Styles** section of the **Home** page shows your most recently-updated styles created or edited with the Mapbox Studio style editor. You can see a full list of your styles on the **[Styles](#styles-1)** page.

![home styles]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/styles.png)

For each style, you can either click on the name of the style to go to its [information page](#style-information-page), click **Edit** to open the style in the style editor, or click the <span class='icon menu'></span> button for more options (see the **[Styles](#styles-1)** section below for more information on these options).

### Tilesets

The **Tilesets** section of the **Home** page shows your most recently-uploaded tilesets. You can see a full list of your uploaded tilesets on the **[Tilesets](#tilesets-1)** page.

![home tilesets]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/tilesets.png)

For each tileset, you can either click on the name of the tileset to go to its information page or click the <span class='icon menu'></span> button for more options (see the **[Tilesets](#tilesets-1)** section below for more information on these options).

### API access token

Your [access tokens]({{site.baseurl}}/define-access-token) provide access to Mapbox styles and data when using any of our [APIs and SDKs]({{site.url}}/developers). The token shown on the **Home** page is your default public token &mdash; you can create additional access tokens on your [account page]({{site.url}}/studio/account/tokens/).

### Classic styles and projects

Looking for your [Mapbox Studio Classic styles]({{site.url}}/studio/classic/) and [Mapbox Editor]({{site.url}}/editor) projects? You can access these from the right sidebar on the **Home** page and via the link in the left side navigation.

![classic home]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/classic-styles.png)

_Note: Classic styles and Mapbox Editor projects cannot be edited with the Mapbox Studio style editor. We recommended [upgrading to Mapbox Studio]({{site.baseurl}}/upgrading-from-classic/) to take advantage of the full experience of the Mapbox GL rendering engine and styling capabilities of Mapbox Studio._

### Get help

Click **[Welcome]({{site.url}}/studio/welcome)** in the top right corner of the **Home** page for additional information to help you jump right in and create map styles with Mapbox Studio.

![studio welcome]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/welcome.png)

Not seeing what you need? [Contact us]({{site.url}}/contact/) with any questions you have along the way.

## Styles

From the **Styles** page you can create, manage, and edit any of your [styles]({{site.baseurl}}/define-style).

![styles]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/styles.png)

### Create a new style

To create a new style, click **New style** at the top of the page.

From here, you can pick a Mapbox template style or start from scratch. Select a template and click **Create** to start editing in the Mapbox Studio style editor.

![create styles]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/style-create.png)

### Manage and edit existing styles

The **Styles** page also shows all of the styles you've created or edited with the Mapbox Studio style editor. For each style, you can either click on the name of the style to go to its [information page](#style-information-page), click **Edit** to open the style in the style editor, or click the <span class='icon menu'></span> button for more options:

<img src='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/styles-edit-options.png' class='fr pad1x'>

- **Download** &mdash; download the style as a JSON stylesheet in the [Mapbox GL Style Specification]({{site.url}}/mapbox-gl-style-spec)
- **Duplicate** &mdash; create a new style with the same layers and data as the style
- **Replace** &mdash; upload a new JSON stylesheet to replace the style
- **Delete** &mdash; delete the style
- **Revert to last publish** &mdash; discard any tracked changes since the last save

From the Classic styles page you can also **Edit** your created styles in the Mapbox Studio style editor or click on the menu button, which gives you options to __Download__, __Duplicate__, __Replace__, __Delete__, __Save changes__, and __Revert to last save__.

<p class='clearfix'></p>

<aside>Mapbox Studio automatically tracks every change you make when editing your style, but you have to <strong>Publish</strong> to update your map style.</aside>

From this menu, you can also copy the **style URL** to add the style to your app created with [Mapbox GL JS]({{site.url}}/mapbox-gl-js/api/) or one of our [mobile SDKs]({{site.url}}/mobile).

### Style information page

Each style has an **information page** that describes metadata about the data sources and layers in the style.

![style]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/style-info.png)

The information page shows you a list of tilesets that are used in the style. Underneath the name of each tileset is a list of **subsets**, and each subset contains a list of **[layers]({{site.baseurl}}/define-layer)**.

<aside>Tilesets are <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/">sources</a>. Sources include vector or raster data files uploaded to your account. Your account also includes access to <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/">Mapbox sources</a>.</aside>

- A **subset** is a selected portion of a tileset. Multiple subsets only appear in the Mapbox Streets and Mapbox Terrain tilesets &mdash; if you are uploading your own data sources, they will only have one subset. The icon next to the subset title indicates whether the subset contains mostly points, lines, or polygons.
- A **layer** is a set of style rules for a subset or a selection within a subset. You can define a layer for an entire subset, or you can filter the data and create a layer for just a portion of the subset. You can also create multiple layers for the same subset.

If you click on a layer, the Mapbox Studio style editor will open directly to the styling pane for quick access to style the layer.

### Attribution requirements

According to the Mapbox [Terms of Service]({{site.url}}/tos/), you are required to provide proper [attribution]({{site.baseurl}}/attribution) if you are using data from Mapbox Streets or OpenStreetMap. The required attribution text is listed on your **[Styles]({{site.url}}/studio/styles)** page.

### Fonts

Click **[Fonts]({{site.url}}/styles/fonts)** in the top right corner of the **Styles** page to add and manage fonts for your styles.

![fonts]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/styles-fonts.png)

To upload a new font for use in a style, click **Upload fonts** on the top of the page. You may upload a TrueType (TTF) or OpenType (OTF) font. Click a font name to see the various options for each font.

## Tilesets

The **Tilesets** page is where you can add and manage your uploaded tilesets.

![tilesets]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/tilesets.png)

### Upload a tileset

To upload a new tileset, click **New tileset** at the top of the page, select your data, and click **Upload**. Data must be in one of the [accepted data formats]({{site.baseurl}}/uploads/#accepted-data-types).

_Note: When a vector data file is uploaded to Mapbox, it is converted to [vector tile format]({{site.baseurl}}/define-vector-tiles). When a [raster]({{site.baseurl}}/define-raster) data file (like an image) is uploaded to Mapbox, it becomes a set of tiled PNGs._

### Manage and edit existing tilesets

The **Tilesets** page also shows you a list of all of your uploaded tilesets, plus the three Mapbox-provided tilesets: [Mapbox Streets]({{site.url}}/developers/vector-tiles/mapbox-streets), [Mapbox Satellite]({{site.url}}/satellite), and [Mapbox Terrain]({{site.url}}/developers/vector-tiles/mapbox-terrain). Your uploaded tilesets appear below.

<img src='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/tileset-options.png' class='pad1x'>

For each tileset, you can either click on the name of the tileset to go to its information page or click the <span class='icon menu'></span> button for more options:

- **Replace** &mdash; replace the data in this tileset with different data
- **Delete** &mdash; delete the tileset
- **Make private** &mdash; make the tileset private

From this menu, you can also copy the **Map ID**.

### Tileset information page

![data info]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/tilesets-info.png)

Each tileset has an information page that provides additional information about the tileset. It includes three tabs:

- **Subsets** &mdash; groupings of data within the tileset. Your custom tilesets will only have one subset; Mapbox Streets and Mapbox Terrain include multiple subsets. Each subset in the listing has information on geometry type, zoom levels of the data, and data attributes and value types. Click the **Add to style** button to add the subset to a new or existing style.
- **Used in styles** &mdash; lists the styles in which the tileset is used.
- **Stats** &mdash; shows analytics for the tileset, including [map views]({{site.baseurl}}/define-map-view), [static API]({{site.baseurl}}/define-static-api) requests, and [surface API]({{site.baseurl}}/define-surface) requests.

## Stats

Your **Statistics** page contains analytics and information about your Mapbox account. The page has two tabs: **API** and **Mobile**.

![stats]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/stats-referrers.png)

### API

The API page shows statistics based on your total account activity or an individual [access token]({{site.baseurl}}/define-access-token). Results can be broken down by specific timeframes (week, month, year, or custom date range).

For each of the following statistics, information is included on the referrers (websites using your maps), map IDs, countries, and browsers from which the requests originated. Note: You will only see the statistics for the APIs you have access to.

The following stats appear on every account:

- **Map views:** The number of [map views]({{site.baseurl}}/define-map-view) on the selected access token.
- **Static maps:** The number of requests made to the [Static API]({{site.baseurl}}/define-static-api) on the selected access token.
- **Ephemeral geocodes:** The number of requests made to the [Geocoding API]({{site.baseurl}}/define-geocoding) (`mapbox.places` endpoint) on the selected access token.

The following stats appear on accounts that have access to these APIs:

- **Permanent geocodes:** The number of requests made to the Geocoding API (`mapbox.places-permanent` endpoint) on the selected access token.
- **Directions:** The number of requests made to the [Directions API]({{site.url}}/developers/api/directions/) on the selected access token.
- **Surface API:** The number of requests made to the [Surface API]({{site.url}}/developers/api/surface/) on the selected access token.

### Mobile

The Mobile page shows statistics based on your total account activity in mobile applications or an individual access token used in a mobile application. Results can be broken down by specific timeframes (week, month, or year). Note: statistics currently only show if you have set up a mobile app with the Mapbox iOS or Android SDKs.

![mau]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/studio/dashboard.jpg)

- **Users:** This section includes the number of unique daily users of apps using the selected access token. It also includes the number of average daily users, the day in the period with the most users, the time of day with the most users, and the percentage of time the app was used for each hour of the day.
- **Interactions:** Mobile interactions include map load, pan, zoom, and rotate. This section includes the number of interaction events in the given time period for the selected access token, the average number of daily interactions, the day in the period with the most interactions, the time of day with the most interactions, and the percentage of time the app was interacted with for each hour of the day.
- **Device:** This section includes information about the devices accessing your mobile applications: operating system, carrier, font scale, pixel ratio, battery level, orientation, and connection type.
