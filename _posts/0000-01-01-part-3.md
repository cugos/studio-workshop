## Uploading a tileset
Uploading custom data to Mapbox Studio will convert the data file into [vector tiles]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-vector-tiles). Vector tiles can be used in any Mapbox Studio style and filtered or styled as is into your map. There are multiple ways to upload files to your Mapbox account:

- Directly in Mapbox Studio style editor
- On the Home and Data pages in Mapbox Studio
- Through Mapbox Studio Classic source mode
- Through the Mapbox Uploads API

### Accepted data types

You can upload the following data types to your Mapbox account:

- [MBTiles]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-mbtiles)
- [KML]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-kml)
- [GPX]({{site.basuerl}}/define-gpx)
- [GeoJSON]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-geojson)
- [Shapefile (zipped)]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-shapefile)
- [CSV]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-csv)
- [GeoTIFF]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-tiff)

When a vector data file is uploaded to Mapbox, it is converted to [vector tile]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-vector-tiles) format. When a [raster]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-raster) data file (like an image) is uploaded to Mapbox, it becomes a set of tiled PNGs. When uploading through Mapbox Studio Classic source mode, you can manually determine maximum and minimum zoom levels for the tileset; for all other upload methods, maximum and minimum zoom levels are determined based on the data.

### Upload data as a new layer

In Mapbox Studio style editor, click **New layer** on the top left.

![add new layer]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/img/studio/data-new-layer-btn.png)

Next, click **Select a tileset** and you will see an **Upload data** button and a list of the vector and raster tile tilesets in your Mapbox account. Click **Upload data** and navigate to your tileset on your local machine.

![select tileset]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/img/studio/data-select-data-options.jpg)

From here, you can continue by setting data filters and adding style rules to the layer.


### Upload data from your Tilesets page

On your Tilesets page, click **New tileset** at the top and navigate to your tileset on your local machine.

![data page new tileset]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/img/studio/tilesets-page-new.png)

Once you **Select a tileset** and press the **Upload** button, the process will begin and an uploads pane will appear in the lower left corner of the page. This pane shows the status of your upload, you will see your **map ID**, with a blue dot as the file is *Processing*.

![uploads pane]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/img/studio/data-processing-data.png)

Once the file has successfully uploaded, the circle will turn green with the message *Succeeded*. Click the **map ID** to view the details of your tileset on a new page.

![add to style]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/img/studio/data-upload-success.png)

From this page, you can add the tileset to any style.

For more information about uploading data to your Mapbox account, see the [Uploads]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/uploads) page.

## Exercise: Upload data

For this exercise, we're going to download the following data from the [data.seattle.gov](https://data.seattle.gov/) and then upload it to your account. Download the data here:

<button class='button'><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/data/Seattle_Traffic_Cameras.csv">
Download Cameras.csv</a></button>

<button class='button'><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/data/uw-buildings.geojson">Download buildings.geojson</a></button>

<button class='button'><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/data/uw-cycleway.geojson">Download Cycleways.geojson</a></button>

Follow these next steps to follow along:

1. go to your [Tilesets](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/tilesets/) page and drag and drop your downloaded file to the page. 
1. depending on your connection, your file should upload within minutes.
1. add the new tileset to your **Existing style** from Part II.
1. once the editor has started and your in creating a new layer, confirm it's being added with the type **point**

## Manage data
You can manage your data in a number of ways:

- replace
- delete
- make private

## Access tokens

- creating tokens
- rotating tokens
- scopes
