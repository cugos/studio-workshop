There are multiple ways to upload files to your Mapbox account:

- Directly in Mapbox Studio style editor
- On the Home and Data pages in Mapbox Studio
- Through Mapbox Studio Classic source mode
- Through the Mapbox Uploads API

## Accepted data types

You can upload the following data types to your Mapbox account:

- [MBTiles]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-mbtiles)
- [KML]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-kml)
- [GPX]({{site.basuerl}}/define-gpx)
- [GeoJSON]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-geojson)
- [Shapefile (zipped)]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-shapefile)
- [CSV]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-csv)
- [GeoTIFF]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-tiff)

When a vector data file is uploaded to Mapbox, it is converted to [vector tile]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-vector-tiles) format. When a [raster]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-raster) data file (like an image) is uploaded to Mapbox, it becomes a set of tiled PNGs. When uploading through Mapbox Studio Classic source mode, you can manually determine maximum and minimum zoom levels for the tileset; for all other upload methods, maximum and minimum zoom levels are determined based on the data.

## Uploading

- To upload sources directly in Mapbox Studio, see [this guide]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/add-custom-data).
- To upload sources through Mapbox Studio Classic, see the [Mapbox Studio Classic source quickstart guide]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/source-quickstart). For styles, see the [Mapbox Studio Classic style quickstart guide]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/style-quickstart).
- To upload through the Mapbox Uploads API, check out [the documentation]({{site.url}}/developers/api/uploads) and see this guide on [using cURL with the Uploads API]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/upload-curl).
