At the core of Mapbox Studio is the **style editor**, a visual tool for creating custom map styles to your exact specifications. This guide will cover the basics of how a map style is structured and will walk through the options in the style editor interface. It will also share some productivity tips to help you work effectively.

## Mapbox Studio style editor

The **Mapbox Studio style editor** is a visual interface for creating and editing map styles. It is appropriate for beginners and experts alike, with an intuitive interface full of powerful tools useful for everyone, from novices to seasoned cartographers and designers.

## Map styles

The Mapbox Studio style editor is a tool for creating [map styles]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-style). A **style** is a set of rules for how your map will be drawn on the page -- it includes references to your data, map images (icons, markers, patterns), fonts, and, most importantly, it defines how all of your data should be styled on your map. This is done through creation of [layers]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/define-layer). Most of what you do in the Mapbox Studio style editor will involve creating and editing layers.

_On a technical level, map styles are JSON stylesheets written to adhere to the [Mapbox GL Style Specification]({{site.url}}/mapbox-gl-style-spec). These stylesheets are read by the renderer to display a map on the page, and many parts of the stylesheet can be edited client-side with [Mapbox GL JS]({{site.url}}/mapbox-gl-js)._

## Layers

<div class='pad1y'></div>

A **layer** is a styled representation of map data. It contains both a reference to the data it's using as well as styling rules to be applied to that data.

You can create, sort, and group your layers within the **Layers** panel.

- [Style multiple layers at the same time in Mapbox Studio]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/style-multiple-layers/)

### Adding layers

Add and style data on your map by creating new layers in the Mapbox Studio style editor. Each layer has two main parts: the data that is being styled and the style rules themselves.

### Data

As you add layers, you must define the tilesets they are representing. On the **Select data** tab of your layer, you can pick your tileset, upload new data, define the data types, adjust zoom extent, and filter your data by attributes or classes.

![studio-editor]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/img/studio/editor-ui-data.png)

Data uploaded through the style editor interface is available on your **[Data]({{site.url}}/studio/data)** page and can be used in any of your styles.

### Style

![studio-editor]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/img/studio/editor-ui-style.png)

After your data is in place, you can style every element of your data based on data type. Each data type has its own set of properties to apply a style. Data types include:

- [line]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/style-line-layer-studio)
- [symbol]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/style-symbol-layer-studio)
- [fill]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/style-fill-layer-studio)
- [circle]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/style-circle-layer-studio)
- [raster]({{site.url}}/mapbox-gl-style-spec/#raster)
- [background]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/style-background-layer-studio)

See the [Mapbox Studio help docs]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/#design-a-map) for more guidance on styling layers.

## Managing your styles

You can manage various aspects of your styles using the **Properties** panel, the **Navigation** toolbar, and the **History, Debug, & Help** options.

### Properties

The **Properties** panel can be used to manage the overall style of your map by editing style properties in bulk. View your map styles by properties **Colors**, **Numbers**, **Images**, **Font stacks**, **Text field**, or **Options** to see the styles you've set _globally_ for each layer.

You can sort options for each property by **Layer count** or **Name**, filter by data type, and view **By value** or **By property**. This panel also shows which layer is **Used in** each property and you can click to open any layer for direct editing.

### Search, fullscreen, and zoom

The search button allows you to search for locations on the map as well as layers or data sources. You can find this button on the top right. Click the search icon, type in what you're looking for, and select to be taken to that exact location or layer.

Right next to the search button is the fullscreen button. This button allows you to clear from the canvas any layers or panels that may be open. Move between zoom levels with zoom in and zoom out buttons.

![studio-editor]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/img/studio/editor-side-search.gif)

### Position

Click the position button to view and alter the zoom level, bearing, pitch, and centerpoint longitude, latitude direction. Under the **Default position**, lock the current map position to save the current location; your map will return to that location when you re-open the style. This position will also be used in Mapbox developer tools if no other coordinates are specified.

![studio-editor]({{site.mbbaseurl}}/img/studio/editor-map-position.gif)

If you have altered the pitch, click the reset pitch icon to quickly set your map's pitch back to zero.

### Help

The help button allows you to toggle on **Intro** and **Advanced tips** cards in the interface. These cards and call-outs can help you better understand the tools in Mapbox Studio. As you scroll down on this panel, you will see a list of all the keyboard shortcuts you can use.

At the top of the help panel, you have links to [Mapbox help]({{site.mbbaseurl}}) and our [Contact page]({{site.url}}/contact).

# Mapbox data

## Streets

Worldwide, detailed street data powered by the OpenStreetMap community's 2 million members updating the map in real time. Each day thousands of volunteers refine the map by adding new roads, buildings, and parks — everything that matters for cities and towns across the globe.

**25 million miles of roads**

OpenStreetMap has one of the most complete street datasets in the world.

**126 million building footprints**

Building data adds context to maps and improves the quality of directions and geocoding results.

**2,000,000 users**

OpenStreetMap is growing at a rate of over 1,000 new mappers every day.


## Terrain

Hillshades orient runners, topography lines let hikers judge ascents, roads are designed to overlay GPS tracks from your rides. We processed the best elevation and landcover information we could find from around the world — 24 different datasets from 13 organizations, including the US Geological Survey, the Norwegian Mapping Authority, and the Canadian GeoBase data portal.

**Terabytes of data**

Mapbox Terrain is processed from dozens of curated datasets from around the world.

**56 trillion pixels**

We vectorized 56 trillion pixels of raw elevation data to create scalable hillshades and contours for the whole world.

**Optimized for styling**

Each zoom level is custom-designed to look great, and landuse classifications are simplified for straightforward styling.

## Satellite

Mapbox Satellite offers highly detailed imagery of the entire world. From tasking satellites to flying planes to controlling drones, we source, process, and color-correct millions of images. We're creating the best-looking, most accurate, and most up-to-date satellite imagery available anywhere. And it's really fast.

**Cloudless Atlas**

The perfect summer day at the highest resolution for the entire world.

**Satellite Live**

Processing pixel-by-pixel via our scalable cloud-based imagery pipeline.

**NASA, DigitalGlobe, USGS**

Our imagery is sourced from the leading open and largest commercial providers.
